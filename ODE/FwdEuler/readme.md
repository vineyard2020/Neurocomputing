We will demonstrate our proposed accelerators by solving the Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the predatorprey equations. These are a pair of first-order, nonlinear, differential equations forming a 2x2 ODE system and are frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey.

Euler's method is a numerical method to solve first order first degree differential equation with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and is the simplest Runge–Kutta method. The Euler method is named after Leonhard Euler, who treated it in his book Institutionum calculi integralis (published 1768–1870).

The Euler method is a first-order method, which means that the local error (error per step) is proportional to the square of the step size, and the global error (error at a given time) is proportional to the step size. The Euler method often serves as the basis to construct more complex methods, e.g., predictor–corrector method.

A closely related derivation is to substitute the forward finite difference formula for the derivative. Called Forward Euler.
